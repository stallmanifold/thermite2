# Thermite OS v2
This is the next iteration of an experimental operating system written in Rust. 

### Status
This OS is experimental only.

### TODO:
The first milestone we are trying to achieve is to implement the necessary functionality to have memory management. This allows us to unlock access to `libcore` and eventually `libstd`.
